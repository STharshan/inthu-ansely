      "text": "Your website is often the first impression customers have of your business. In a world saturated with generic templates, custom websites stand out by telling your unique story and delivering experiences tailored to your audience. But custom doesn't mean complicated. The best custom websites are elegant, fast, and purpose-built to achieve specific business objectives."

I test every site on actual devices, not just browser dev tools. Real users hold phones differently than simulators suggest."
