    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Custom software is built specifically for your business, your workflows, and your goals. It adapts to how you work, not the other way around. But building custom software requires careful planning, the right team, and a clear understanding of your requirements."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Custom software is worth the investment when: your processes are unique to your industry, off-the-shelf solutions require extensive customization, you need specific integrations, compliance requirements are strict, or you need a competitive advantage that competitors can't easily replicate."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "If a standard solution fits 80% of your needs with minimal customization, it's usually the better choice. But when you're constantly working around software limitations, custom development becomes the smarter long-term investment."

    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Agile methodologies allow for flexibility and continuous feedback. Start with a minimum viable product (MVP), gather user feedback, and iterate. This approach reduces risk and ensures the final product meets actual needs."
