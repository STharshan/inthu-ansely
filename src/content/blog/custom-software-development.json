      "text": "I spent six months watching a client try to force their unique workflow into a standard CRM. They customised it so heavily that updates broke everything. They spent more time working around limitations than using the system. Finally, they asked us to build something custom. The new system cut their daily admin time from four hours to 30 minutes."

      "text": "Custom software is worth the investment when your processes are unique to your industry, off-the-shelf solutions require extensive customization, you need specific integrations, compliance requirements are strict, or you need a competitive advantage that competitors can't easily replicate."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "If a standard solution fits 80% of your needs with minimal customization, it's usually the better choice. But when you're constantly working around software limitations, custom development becomes the smarter long-term investment. I've seen companies spend more on customizing generic software than they would have on building custom from scratch."

      "text": "Agile methodologies allow for flexibility and continuous feedback. Start with a minimum viable product (MVP). Gather user feedback. Iterate. This approach reduces risk and ensures the final product meets actual needs. I've never seen a perfect first version. But I've seen many great second and third versions."

I've seen too many projects where security was an afterthought. Fixing security issues after the fact costs ten times more than building it right initially."
