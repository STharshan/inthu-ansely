They needed better processes. The third had a perfect use case that AI could transform. Understanding the difference is what separates successful AI implementations from expensive experiments."

Do you have enough volume for meaningful insights? I've seen AI projects fail because the data wasn't ready, not because the technology wasn't capable."
